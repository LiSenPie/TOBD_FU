       "  'i recently tried a russian honey cake, which was one of the yummiest cakes i have ever tasted. it was so nice i decided to find the recipe and learn to make it myself. it took me about 6 months searching the net (on websites mostly in russian, which i definitely don\\'t read or speak) translating from russian using an online translator, and trying different recipes before i found this recipe, which has produced a result at least as nice as the one i tried.\\r\\n\\r\\ni baked 2 pieces at a time on baking paper on an oven tray. each batch took just long enough to cook, that i had two more ready to swap when the first ones were done.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe cream filling (and coating) is made from sour cream and sugar. the sour cream is simply whipped with the sugar until the sugar dissolves. the original recipe said to add sugar \"by intuition\"; i think you\\'re supposed to keep adding more until it thickens, but the time i tried that it was too sickly sweet!\\r\\n\\r\\ni have also made the filling/coating using fresh cream - 750ml, soured with 1/2 cup lemon juice and beaten until just starting to thicken (you still use the sugar & honey). this was for a vegetarian who pointed out that the cultured sour cream i used had gelatin in it. a slightly different taste, but a very nice variation.\\r\\n\\r\\ni personally don\\'t like walnuts all that much, so i leave them out whenever i cook this.',\n",

Then I put it in a pan greased with some of the peanut oil on top of the peanut butter.  (I use only natural chunky peanut butter - don't want any more sugar or hydrogenated anything!)

The glaze is TDF good, a fudgy smooth consistency, and even DH who doesn\\'t like coconut thought the shredded coconut on top was perfect. So, for taste we all would agree on a definite 5 stars. :) My concern is that the recipe could benefit from some modifications & clarifications. The first thing I would want to point out is that the recipe as printed doesn\\'t make just \"large\" cupcakes. It will make JUMBO cupcakes. I don\\'t have a jumbo pan so I would have cut the recipe down had I known before hand. Instead I ended up making 36 regular sized cupcakes & because they had to be cooled in the pan before removing to wire rack (& because of the cakes\\' texture, this was in fact necessary) it took 3 hours just to bake all 36 cakes (2 days from start to finish). As far as the recipe, I think there is much too much butter. So much that the muffin tins felt as if I\\'d greased them before putting the paper liners in, but I didn\\'t. I also think the amount of sugar called for is overkill. They didn\\'t taste overly sweet, but the tops of the cakes are nearly caramelized. The butter sank to the bottom & made the cake greasy while the sugar floated to the top & turned into a sticky candy coating. Removing the cakes from the pan &/or removing the paper liners without tearing the entire top of the cake was a very slow & tedious process. I did enough to get a satisfactory photo but will just let everyone remove their own now. :) Again, this recipe is worth the effort in flavor & we would give 5 stars for that. Thanks for sharing, my3bb! Made for ZWT5-Ali Baba\\'s Babes.  UPDATE:  It\\'s been 4 days since I made these & they\\'ve been sitting out on the counter the whole time (not covered or sealed).  I just finished eating one & cannot believe that it\\'s still SO GOOD!  They\\'re not greasy anymore & still aren\\'t dried out.  The cake is still moist & only just approaching the \"day old\" stage around the top edge that isn\\'t in paper or covered in frosting.  The frosting is like biting into a rich, creamy fudge & was such a nice surprise.  I\\'m tempted to say that making these a day or two ahead of an event would be just perfect as far as their aging to perfection & the convenience of being able to make a baked good ahead.  :)'),\n",

The amount of gluten is definitely necessary for binding all the chickpeas together, but its texture is too overbearing.

Very staight-forward preparation, the biggest challenge is getting the filled wrappers into a uniform eye pleasing shape. I did sustitute ground turkey (didn't have a chilli pepper), opted for peas, and otherwise stuck to the recipe. The first test batch was less than impressive, the wonton wrappers were a dry/crisp and dull, so after asking-used a very light brush of oil and a pinch of salt made them soft and inviting(can also use cooking oil spray). I found the spice level/combination very agreeable but felt it was repetitious(maybe because of the turkey being less powerful than beef) and in need something. I noticed other people use rasins or sultanas so I chopped some for a second test batch--yummy! They added a needed contrast for my liking and the taste was complete. I wanted to give 5 stars but I've never had Samosas before so I can't say how traditional these taste.\\r\\nAs far as quantity,I made 12-15 filled wonton wraps and filled a small burrito wrap for neighbor to munch on and still had about 3/4 of the mixture remaining (in the fridge for tommorow) so I'd say #60 individual peices easily. This is a great filling to make ahead or freeze for time saving convenience.\\r\\nThumbs up!\"),\n",

Because ultimately, the flavor is quite bland ... maybe that's what you want from a Tuna Bake ... but when I think Australia these days, I think sharp flavors -- seared tuna with ginger and soy, that Asian influence ... this recipe doesn't go in that direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's easy to add that kick -- some red pepper flakes, or coconut milk instead of cow's milk, with a hint of curry. If you're cooking for adults, you might do that ... for kids, you might not ... but that's a different recipe and a different mindset.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the tuna bake that reminds me of when I was a child ... this is a 5. as the tuna bake I might go for today ... it's a 4 ... and you'll have to decide what it is for you.\"),\n",

So I decided to give this a try (If you can't trust Fannie who can you trust?

The corn I omitted because of an allergy, and I also didn\\'t bother to add the water because I prefer a thicker chili.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fiance and I were both really happy with with the final result (and our roomie, upon tasting it, said \"Damn! That\\'s good chili!\" and promptly begged for permission to also have some for lunch the next day :) ). It IS a little salty for me, however, which I attribute to the sausage.

Although the recipe calls for straining the mixture before serving, I opted not to, and instead used a hand blender to puree it even more finely in the pan.  I like the texture this way, and so did DH.  He actually thought it should be a bit thicker, which I may accomplish next time by adding a little flour between steps one and two.  My only issue, and it's a minor one, was the balance of flavor between the corn and the onion.  I thought the onion was a little strong, so next time I think I'll either use a little less, or use a sweet onion instead of the plain yellow onion that I used this time.

This  turned out perfectly and I received MANY compliments! The best compliment was when someone asked if there was yeast in it, like in cinnamon rolls. I explained that it just puffs up when baked. I think that is the neatest part of it! I had pancake syrup for a topping but most ate it plain (but this dish is anything but plain!) and sprinkled it liberally with powdered sugar. For ease of cutting I reccomend lining the two layers up together. I suggest to others to let the casserole rest before cutting and lift up some pieces of the bread so the melted butter distributes throughout the pan. This looked gorgeous and I think it was the \"hit\" of the breakfast (if I do say so myself!). Thanks Kozmic Blues, for posting.\\nRoxygirl'),\n",

I always approach kugel recipes as fair game: an opportunity to vary what I throw in and what I omit according to the whim of the moment.  It was a while since I'd made kugel so I approached making this dish with considerable enthusiasm.  I made a few changes because of personal taste preferences and a few additions because I love the additional ingredients.  I omitted the hot pepper sauce and used only 1/2 teaspoon of worcestershire sauce (we have almost zero tolerance of anything hot and spicy), I doubled the garlic and I added an onion and one leek: just love the combination of onions, garlic and leek.  I also added a cup of thinly sliced mushrooms.  I added basil and oregano (as in the ingredients list) but also added rosemary, sage and thyme. I used low-fat cottage cheese and low-fat sour cream as I find that low-fat versions of these makes no appreciable difference to the final dish.  Once all the ingredients had been combined, I added two eggs - as eggs have featured in most other kugel recipes I've made.  I baked the kugel in several smaller dishes as two were destined for the freezer.  I look forward to making this again - probably quite differently next time.
